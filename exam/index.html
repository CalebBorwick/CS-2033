                        Is there a difference between tax evasion and a simple error or miscalculation? The answer is yes, tax fraud and tax evasion require that there is a willful or intentional wrongdoing involved.
                        As anyone who has ever been re-assessed or penalized for late-filing or unpaid taxes knows, the IRA is arrogant and unforgiving.

                        The first issue in any drug case is the legality of the original encounter between the accused and the police. Each charge carries a different consequence. You may be facing a simple misdemeanor or a felony which may carry up to a life sentence. Every drug charge is unique. Strict procedures and laws must be followed in order for the charges to be upheld.
